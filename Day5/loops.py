i=1
while i <= 10:
    print(5*i)
    i += 1


# i is that we are starting our digit like i=1 we are starting from io1 
#  while i <= , i >=  , i< or i> this is condition go till that point eg 10:

# then loop go till 10 whether it is <= ,>= , < or >

# print what we are going to print we can pirnt many thing simple i where it wil go till 10 before we put 5*i to print 5 table 

# while is where it will go
